Working project of trying to parse a complex JSON structure into Scala case class

I have been able to parse one instance of the event as denoted by "EventId".

But do not know how to parse it if there were several events denoted by different "EventId" s.

I dont have a proper sample of what the JSON would look like if there were several events.

- sample1.json sample json file
